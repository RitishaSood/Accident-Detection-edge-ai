# Accident Detection Edge AI System

## Problem
Road accidents often go unreported for several minutes, leading to delayed emergency response, traffic congestion, and secondary accidents.

## Solution
This project uses computer vision and edge AI to automatically detect road accidents from video feeds and generate real-time alerts for nearby vehicles.

## How It Works
1. Video input is taken from a road camera, dashcam, or drone
2. Computer vision detects vehicles and possible collisions
3. Accident severity is estimated
4. Alerts are generated for nearby vehicles or systems

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- PyTorch

## Current Status
Week 1: Accident detection from video (in progress)
